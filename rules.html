                              <p>Project - EsSAT is committed to respecting and upholding the religious values that define our organization. In alignment with these values, we implement gender-segregated sections for all in-person tutoring sessions. This policy is designed to foster a respectful, focused, and effective learning environment. Separate classrooms for biologically male and biologically female students will ensure that all students receive the same high-quality instruction and support.</p>
                              <p>A study by Harvard University has shown the benefits of gender-segregated settings in enhancing students’ focus and academic performance. This further supports our policy of maintaining separate classrooms.</p>
                              <p><strong>Non-Discrimination</strong></p>
                              <p>While maintaining our religious values, Project - EsSAT is dedicated to providing an inclusive and respectful environment for all students, regardless of race, color, national origin, or disability. We comply with all applicable anti-discrimination laws and regulations.</p>
                              <p><strong>Rights Related to Religious Organizations</strong></p>
                              <p>Project - EsSAT operates under the protections afforded by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution, which guarantees the right to freedom of religion. This includes the right to establish policies and practices in alignment with our religious beliefs, including gender-segregated educational settings. We respect and uphold these rights to ensure that our organization operates in accordance with our religious values and principles.</p>
